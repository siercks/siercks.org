<body style="left">

    <div>My name is Andrew Siercks. I grew up in a suburb of Kansas City called Kearney, MO. I've always loved technology and love dabbling in different areas of it.
    <br /><br />
        During 2020 I returned to college at Arizona State University and in May of 2022, graduated with a Bachelor of Planning in Urban Planning. City composition has always been an interest of mine and I love city design!</div>
