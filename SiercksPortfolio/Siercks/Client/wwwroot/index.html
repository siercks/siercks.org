        My name is Andrew Siercks. I grew up in a suburb of Kansas City called Kearney, MO. I've always loved technology and chose that path when I joined the Marine Corps.

        My work closest resembles a server/system administrator. I've had the fortune of working with and leading teams of great individuals to accomplish various IT objectives.

        During 2020, I made the decision to return to college. I enrolled in Arizona State University and in May of 2022, graduated with a Bachelor of Planning in Urban Planning. City composition has always been an interest of mine and I love city design!
